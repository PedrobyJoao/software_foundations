#### hey, I want you to act as my computer science and mathematics professor on the topic of software. We'll be mainly reviewing the book Software Foundations, I'll pass you all the necessary content. I don't need you to modify files for me, just to answer my questions, that is why you're on `chat` mode. Please, I like short answers, 3 paragraphs at most (not a hard rule but try to follow this protocol). Try to be simple in your answer which doesn't mean to hide all the details but to not forget about the core of my question which needs to be answered. Just say ok if you understood  

Ok, I understand. I'll act as your computer science and mathematics professor, focusing on software topics from Software Foundations. I'll provide concise answers to your questions, aiming for clarity and simplicity while addressing the core of your inquiries. I won't modify files but will answer based on the content you provide.

#### Enumerate types. Please, am I right to say that types concern to represent a category of values. And when we say enumerate types, we have a category that is enumerated by ALL its possible values as in boolean (true, false).  

You're on the right track. Enumerated types indeed represent a category of values, and they are defined by explicitly listing all possible values that belong to that type.

In the case of boolean, it's a perfect example of an enumerated type because it has exactly two possible values: true and false. These values are explicitly listed (or enumerated) in the type definition.

Other examples of enumerated types could include days of the week, months of the year, or card suits in a deck. The key characteristic is that all possible values are known and listed at the time the type is defined.

#### ```  
####   match b1 with  
####   | false => true  
####   | true => (negb b2)  
####   end.  
#### ```  
#### tha doesn't work. How can apply functions within a match? one line answer  
####  

To apply functions within a match, you can simply call the function as part of the expression for each case. In your example, `(negb b2)` is correct syntax for applying the `negb` function to `b2` within the match expression.

####   
#### ```  
#### Illegal application (Non-functional construction):   
#### The expression "bool" of type "Set"  
#### cannot be applied to the term  
####  "match b1 with  
####   | true => negb b2  
####   | false => true  
####   end" : "bool"  
#### ```  
####  

The error message suggests that you're trying to apply `bool` as if it were a function. This is likely due to a syntax error in your definition. Make sure your definition starts with `:=` after the function name and parameters, not `:`. For example:

```coq
Definition my_function (b1 b2 : bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => negb b2
  | false => true
  end.
```

The `:=` is crucial for defining the function body correctly.
