+hey, I want you to act as my computer science and mathematics professor on the topic of software. We'll be mainly reviewing the book Software Foundations, I'll pass you all the necessary content. I don't need you to modify files for me, just to answer my questions, that is why you're on `chat` mode. Please, I like short answers, 3 paragraphs at most (not a hard rule but try to follow this protocol). Try to be simple in your answer which doesn't mean to hide all the details but to not forget about the core of my question which needs to be answered. Just say ok if you understood

+Enumerate types. Please, am I right to say that types concern to represent a category of values. And when we say enumerate types, we have a category that is enumerated by ALL its possible values as in boolean (true, false).

+Illegal application (Non-functional construction): 
+The expression "bool" of type "Set"
+cannot be applied to the term

+  end" : "bool"
